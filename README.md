PRODIGY_WD_02 To create a full-fledged stopwatch web application, I'll walk you through the entire process, including the HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality. This will allow you to have a working stopwatch with features like starting, stopping, resetting, and recording lap times. Features: Start/Stop button toggles the stopwatch's timer. Reset button resets everything to 00:00:00. Lap button records the current time as a lap and adds it to the list on the right side.
